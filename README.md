# Chain-Reaction ver 1.0

This is an application created using JavaFX which is similar to the game Chain Reaction available on PlayStore and AppStore. This was done as a project for the course Advance Programming (CSE 201) at IIIT Delhi. For back end we have an integer grid in which the value of Player 1 are 1-4, for Player 2 are 5-8 for example in the given grid



                                                              0 1 2 5 7 
                                                              9 11 0 0
                                                              
                                                              
                                                              
The 1 tells us that this is being occupied by Player 1 with 1 Sphere,the 2 tells us that this is being occupied by Player 1 with 2 Spheres, the 5 tells us that this is being occupied by Player 2 with 1 (5%4=1) Sphere, the 7 tells us that this is being occupied by Player 2 with 3 (7%4=3) Spheres, the 9 tells us that this is being occupied by Player 3 with 1 (9%4=1) Sphere,  the 11 tells us that this is being occupied by Player 3 with 3 (11%4=3) Spheres. This prevents creation of Cell class to determine who is occupying the cell.

To play compile and run Main.java program and then type "java Main" to play the game.
